# **Covid-19 Sicily data plotter**

This repository contains the public resources of a website designed in the very early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of the website was to show the statistics of the pandemic specificly for the Sicilian territory. Data was automatically taken from the Ministry of Health database & elaborated by Root every day.

The project is **no longer maintained since June 2020**, after the end of 'first wave' of contagion. Since then, the main websites about Covid 19 monitoring have introduced the option to select data for a specific region of Italy, so there was no longer the need to mantain this project.
